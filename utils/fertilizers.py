                        <li><b>Water your soil: </b>Soaking your soil with water will help leach the nitrogen deeper into your soil, effectively leaving less for your plants to use.</li>
                        <li><b>Add Sugar: </b>In limited studies, it was shown that adding sugar to your soil can help potentially reduce the amount of nitrogen is your soil. Sugar is partially composed of carbon, an element which attracts and soaks up the nitrogen in the soil. This is similar concept to adding sawdust/woodchips which are high in carbon content.</li>

                        <li><b>Add Composted Manure: </b>The most commonly used for fertilizer is cow or poultry manure, but horse, goat, sheep, and rabbit manure also work very well. Just make sure to compost the manure first or it can burn your plants.</li>
                        <li><b>Crab meal: </b>Along with the 6% nitrogen levels, crab meal contains a high portion of lime, so you can use it if you need to make your soil more alkaline. Avoid if you have soils that already have a high pH.</li>
                        <li><b>Rich Compost: </b>The holy grail of garden amendments—it does it all! While compost has a low level of available nitrogen, it does work well as a source of slow-release nitrogen—especially when combined with fast-acting nitrogen fertilizers like fish emulsion.</li>
                        <li><b>Corn Gluten: </b>Corn gluten works as both a nitrogen-rich soil amendment and a weed preventer. However, it keeps all plants from setting roots—so only use this around established plants.</li>
